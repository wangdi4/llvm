#
# This file contains a list of features that are supported by the compiler
# build system, i.e. you may pass these features via LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES cmake
# variable.  Read more details in 'Xmain Development Processes' document.
#
# Each feature specification is of the following form:
#     ^@<feature name>:{SHARED|SECRET}@
#
# Legend:
#   * Feature name must be a valid C identifier.  In general, it should
#     use all capital letters, numbers and '_', and should not start
#     with '_'.
#   * SECRET features are only for xmain repositories.
#   * SHARED features will appear in the collaborative repositories.
#   * Note that SHARED does not mean "public", i.e. features shared
#     via collaborative repositories may not be made public by Intel
#     yet.  In general, codes for public features must be upstreamed,
#     which implies removing the feature guards and, thus, removing
#     these features' declarations from this file.
#
# Extra text (e.g. comments) are allowed after the terminating '@'.
# By convention this file uses '#' as a comment symbol.  At the same time,
# any line not satisfying "^@.*$" regular expression is just ignored.
#
# In general, every new feature must start with INTEL_FEATURE prefix
# followed by '_' and an optional additional prefix corresponding to the feature
# class (see below).  Currently the feature filtering tool will report
# an error, if you use INTEL_FEATURE prefix in this file.  We temporarily
# allow declaring the features without the prefix in this file, but
# the actual feature name passed via LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES must use
# the prefix.  For example, you may declare ISA_VNNI feature here,
# but you have to use concat("INTEL_FEATURE", "_ISA_VNNI") name
# in LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES and in the source files.
#
# There is a set of legacy software features that do not use
# the prefix.

# New ISA features usually use ISA_ prefix, e.g. ISA_VNNI.

# INTEL_FEATURE_XISA_COMMON
# Special guard represents the code is shared by more than one XISA features.
# Please be careful to use the guard in a fine granularity, so that unrelated
# non-public features won't be exposed by mistake when upstream.
# E.g. We have adjacent code shared by different features:
#   Code_Shared_By_Feature_A_B
#   Code_Shared_By_Feature_B_C
# We must use the guard as:
#   # XISA_COMMON (Omit the prefix to make fif happy)
#   Code_Shared_By_Feature_A_B
#   # end XISA_COMMON
#   # XISA_COMMON
#   Code_Shared_By_Feature_B_C
#   # end XISA_COMMON
# Rather than a single joined XISA_COMMON.
# Usually, the code has characteristics by which we know we will upstream it
# when one of the features, e.g. feature A, is disclosed. Through the fine-
# grained guard control, we won't upstream Code_Shared_By_Feature_B_C
# unconsciously.
# The guard usually be removed from XMAIN when feature A downstream by pulldown.
