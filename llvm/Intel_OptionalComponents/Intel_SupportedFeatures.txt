# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file contains a list of features that are supported by the compiler
# build system, i.e. you may pass these features via LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES cmake
# variable.  Read more details in 'Xmain Development Processes' document.
#
# Each feature specification is of the following form:
#     ^@<feature name>:{SHARED|SECRET}@
#
# Legend:
#   * Feature name must be a valid C identifier.  In general, it should
#     use all capital letters, numbers and '_', and should not start
#     with '_'.
#   * SECRET features are only for xmain repositories.
#   * SHARED features will appear in the collaborative repositories.
#   * Note that SHARED does not mean "public", i.e. features shared
#     via collaborative repositories may not be made public by Intel
#     yet.  In general, codes for public features must be upstreamed,
#     which implies removing the feature guards and, thus, removing
#     these features' declarations from this file.
#
# Extra text (e.g. comments) are allowed after the terminating '@'.
# By convention this file uses '#' as a comment symbol.  At the same time,
# any line not satisfying "^@.*$" regular expression is just ignored.
#
# In general, every new feature must start with INTEL_FEATURE prefix
# followed by '_' and an optional additional prefix corresponding to the feature
# class (see below).  Currently the feature filtering tool will report
# an error, if you use INTEL_FEATURE prefix in this file.  We temporarily
# allow declaring the features without the prefix in this file, but
# the actual feature name passed via LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES must use
# the prefix.  For example, you may declare ISA_VNNI feature here,
# but you have to use concat("INTEL_FEATURE", "_ISA_VNNI") name
# in LLVM_INTEL_FEATURES and in the source files.
#
# There is a set of legacy software features that do not use
# the prefix.

# New ISA features usually use ISA_ prefix, e.g. ISA_VNNI.
