/// as:
///
/// \code
/// %red = %red + (%A)[i1]; \endcode
///
/// or even more complicated multi-instruction reductions, such as:
///
/// \code
/// %temp1 = %temp3;
/// %temp2 = %temp1 + (%A)[i1];
/// %temp2 = %temp2 - (%A)[i1 + %offs];
/// %temp3 = %temp2 + (%B)[i1]; \endcode
///
/// Supported reduction operations include `max`, `min`, `add`, `sub`, `and`,
/// `or`, `xor`, `mul`, and `div` for integer, floating-point, and vector types.
/// Multi-instruction reduction chains can include copies, and can also include
/// compatible mixed operations (though this is currently only supported for
/// `add`/`sub` reductions).
///
/// In order to use this pass, you must first call
/// \ref computeSafeReductionChains on either the relevant loop or one of its
/// parents:
///
/// \code
/// SRA.computeSafeReductionChains(RedLoop); \endcode
///
/// Once this is done, the reduction information (stored in the form of a
/// SafeRedInfo for each recognized reduction) can be queried for the entire
/// loop using the \ref getSafeRedInfoList method:
///
/// \code
/// for (const SafeRedInfo& Reduction : SRA.getSafeRedInfoList(RedLoop)) {
///   ...
/// } \endcode
///
/// or for individual instructions using the \ref getSafeRedInfo,
/// \ref isSafeReduction, or \ref isReductionRef methods:
///
/// \code
/// for (HLNode& Node :
///      make_range(RedLoop->child_begin(), RedLoop->child_end())) {
///   ...
///   auto*const Inst = dyn_cast<HLInst>(&Node);
///   if (!Inst) continue;
///   ...
///   if (const SafeRedInfo*const Reduction = SRA.getSafeRedInfo(Inst)) {
///     ...
///   }
/// } \endcode
///
/// Aside from the reduction instruction/instruction chain in
/// SafeRedInfo::Chain, SafeRedInfo records also have several fields that are
/// helpful in determining whether a reduction is safe to optimize in the
/// context of a particular transformation. These include SafeRedInfo::OpCode,
/// which indicates the type of reduction operation performed, and
/// SafeRedInfo::HasUnsafeAlgebra, which indicates the absence of certain fast
/// math flags required for certain types of optimizations.
