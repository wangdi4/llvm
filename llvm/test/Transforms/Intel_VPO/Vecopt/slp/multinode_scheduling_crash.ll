; Pair {%i03,%i07} formed multi-node root and next vectorization tree entry
; was pair {%i02,%i06}, also the multi-node trunk.
; For the pair {%i03,%i07} scheduling was skipped because users are in another
; block, but scheduling region for {%i02,%i06} contains instruction %i03 so it
; was scheduled as a single instruction (not as a part of bundle). In such cases
; scheduling data do not have reference back to vectorization tree entry and the
; scheduler assumed it means operand remain original. But multinode reordering
; actually replaced original operands of {%i03,%i07} with the sext instructions.
; Operands reordering is not written back into LLVM IR and is kept in
; vectorization tree entries. Hence walking over %i3 operands taken from IR
; was wrong path and eventually caused a failure on assertion that %i03 turned
; out unscheduled when it had to be.
