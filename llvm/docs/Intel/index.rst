Introduction
============

Xmain is a compiler built on top of LLVM. This section documents the additions
and modifications that separate Xmain from LLVM.

How we propose to document Xmain
================================

Taking advantage of LLVM's in-tree documentation system
-------------------------------------------------------

LLVM already provides an excellent documentation system for itself which can be
built as part of LLVM. There is no need to reinvent any wheels.

Taking advantage of source-code review tools
--------------------------------------------

Since LLVM's documentation system is based on plain-text, the same peer-review
process developers apply for source code can be applied to the documentation.

Taking advantage of the version control system
----------------------------------------------

Placing Xmain's documentation in-tree facilitates applying to documentation the
same principles by which Xmain manages its source code:

* Documentation is written/updated in the relevant sub-project.

* Documentation is promoted as part of the standard promotion process

Intel LLVM Development Process Documentation
============================================

The Intel LLVM development process documentation is currently under review. If
anything looks wrong to you, please contact `ICL Process Team
<mailto:ICLProcessTeam@intel.com>`_.

The LLVM development processes are governed by the `ICL Process Management Team
<mailto:ICLProcessTeam@intel.com>`_. Please direct process related questions or
process change requests to them.

   Describes the decision making process for determining what technology will
   be contributed to open source and what technology will be Intel
   customizations in xmain.
