Introduction
============

Xmain is a compiler built on top of LLVM. This section documents the additions
and modifications that separate Xmain from LLVM.

How we propose to document Xmain
================================

Taking advantage of LLVM's in-tree documentation system
-------------------------------------------------------

LLVM already provides an excellent documentation system for itself which can be
built as part of LLVM. There is no need to reinvent any wheels.

Taking advantage of source-code review tools
--------------------------------------------

Since LLVM's documentation system is based on plain-text, the same peer-review
process developers apply for source code can be applied to the documentation.

Taking advantage of the version control system
----------------------------------------------

Placing Xmain's documentation in-tree facilitates applying to documentation the
same principles by which Xmain manages its source code:

* Documentation is written/updated in the relevant sub-project.

* Documentation is promoted as part of the standard promotion process

Intel LLVM Development Process Documentation
============================================

The LLVM development processes are governed by the `CE DevOps
<mailto:CE.DevOps@intel.com>`_. Please direct process related questions or
process change requests to this team.

Homepage for Xmain Processes documentation:
https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/ITSCompilersDevOps/Xmain

:doc:`IR Suppression in Product Executables <IRSuppression>`
   Describes the rationale behind suppressing IR output in released products
   and the implementation used to do so.

:doc:`IR Version Compatibility <IRVersionCompatibility>`
   Describes the design of Intel-specific versioning in bitcode files and
   how backward compatibility will be handled if the bitcode changes in an
   incompatible way.
