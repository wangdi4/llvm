# This test checks that the temporary files created were removed properly.

# Copy the files into the temporary directory, this is to prevent multiple
# processes accessing the same files when running the test system in parallel.
# RUN: cp %S/Inputs/test_file_8.cpp test_file_8.cpp

# Compile with g++ and LTO
# RUN: g++ -c -flto test_file_8.cpp

# Make sure the temporary directory doesn't exists
# RUN: rm -rf %t_tmp-lld-files

# Create a temporary directory and set $TMP
# RUN: mkdir %t_tmp-lld-files
# RUN: export TMPBCK=$TMP
# RUN: export TMP=%t_tmp-lld-files

# Link
# RUN: ld.lld test_file_8.o -o test_file_8 > %t_out.txt 2>&1

# Collect the data from temporary files
# RUN: ls $TMP > %t_out_files.txt

# Clean the temporary directory first in case the check fails
# RUN: export TMP=$TMPBCK
# RUN: rm -rf %t_tmp-lld-files
# RUN: unset TMPBCK

# RUN: rm test_file_8.o
# RUN: rm test_file_8

# Check that there wasn't any issue while removing the files
