//|	TEST: VR9.CPUwaitOnEvents (TC-57)
//|
//|	Purpose
//|	-------
//|	
//|	Verify that the host can recieve events from CPU device
//|
//|	Method
//|	------
//|
//|	1. Enqueue on a devices queue commands from VR-9, all commands depend on user event
//|	2. User event is set as CL_COMPLETED by another thread
//|	3. Each enqueued commands returns an event upon completion
//|	4. Wait on all events
//|	
//|	Pass criteria
//|	-------------
//|
//|	Verify CL_COMPLETED status for all commands' completion events on CPU

//|
//|	Purpose

//|	Method
//|	------
//|
//|	1. Enqueue on CPU device an instance of a kernel 100 times
