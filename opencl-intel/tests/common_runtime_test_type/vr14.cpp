//|	TEST: VR14.KernelCompilation (TC-76)

//|	
//|	Verify the ability to create kernel objects for all kernel functions in a shared program
//|
//|	Method
//|	------
//|
//|	1. Build program with source of 10 kernels on both CPU and GPU
//|	2. Create 10 kernels for that program (will create for both CPU and GPU)
//|	
//|	Pass criteria
//|	-------------
//|
//|	Verify that valid non-zero kernel objects are returned
