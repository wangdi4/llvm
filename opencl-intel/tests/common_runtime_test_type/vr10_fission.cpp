//|	TEST: VR10_Fission.CPUGPUbinaries (TC-121) 
//|
//|	Purpose
//|	-------
//|	
//|	Verify that it is possible to create a program object for both CPU subdevice and GPU devices
//|	and loads the binary bits specified into program object
//| 
//|	Method
//|	------
//|
//|	1.	Create a program object for both CPU subdevice and GPU root device, and load the binary
//|	    bits specified into a program object
//|	2.	Build (compiles & links) a program executable from the program binary for
//|	    both the CPU and the GPU devices.	
//|	
//|	Pass criteria
//|	-------------
//|
//|	A valid non-zero program object should be returned and the program should be built successfully.
