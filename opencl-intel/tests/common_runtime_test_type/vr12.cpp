//|	TEST: VR12.CallbackGPUError (TC-72)
//|
//|	Purpose
//|	-------
//|	
//|	Verify the ability to receive notification with no argument using a callback function
//|	that an application can register and which will be called when the program executable
//|	has been built successfully for CPU device(s) and unsuccessfully for GPU device(s) 
//| 
//|	Method
//|	------
//|
//| 1.	Create a program object and load the source code specified by the text strings
//|     into a program object. The source code is the same for both devices (i.e. no ifdef)
//|     and include an erroneous statement for the GPU device
//| 2.	Try to build (compiles & links) a program executable from the program source for both
//|     the CPU and the GPU devices using a function pointer to a notification routine.ll
//|	
//|	Pass criteria
//|	-------------
//|
//|	The notification routine should be called when the program executable has been built (unsuccessfully).
