//|	Method

//|
//|	1. Create shared input cl_mem buffer on a shared context (shared for CPU subdevice and GPU) with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR
//|	2. For each device create separate output buffer
//|	2. Create for each device a kernel which copies all elements of input buffer into output buffer
//|	3. Run kernels on CPU subdevice and GPU
//|	4. Validate that all output buffers contain elements of input buffer
//|	
//|	Pass criteria
//|	-------------
//|
//|	Validate that each device is able to read all buffer elements
