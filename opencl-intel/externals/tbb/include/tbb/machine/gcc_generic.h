/** As this generic implementation has absolutely no information about underlying
    hardware, its performance most likely will be sub-optimal because of full memory
    fence usages where a more lightweight synchronization means (or none at all)
    could suffice. Thus if you use this header to enable TBB on a new platform,
    consider forking it and relaxing below helpers as appropriate. **/
