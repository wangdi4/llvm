  # embed RPATH and RUNPATH to the binaries that assumes that everything is installed in the same directory
  #
  # Description:
  #   RPATH is used to locate dynamically load shared libraries/objects (DLLs) for the non-standard OS
  #   locations without need of relinking DLLs during installation. The algorithm is the following:
  #
  #   1. If RPATH is present in the EXE/DLL and RUNPATH is NOT present, search through it.
  #   2. If LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable is present, search through it
  #   3. If RUNPATH is present in the EXE/DLL, search through it
  #   4. Search through locations, configured by system admin and cached in /etc/ld.so.cache
  #   5. Search through /lib and /usr/lib
  #
  #   RUNPATH influences only the immediate dependencies, while RPATH influences the whole subtree of dependencies
  #   RPATH is concidered deprecated in favor of RUNPATH, but RUNPATH does not supported by some Linux systems.
  #   If RUNPATH is not supported, system loader may report error - remove "-Wl,--enable-new-dtags" above to
  #   disable RUNPATH generation.
  #
  #   If RPATH or RUNPATH contains string $ORIGIN it is substituted by the full path to the containing EXE/DLL.
  #   Security issue 1: if EXE/DLL is marked as set-uid or set-gid, $ORIGIN is ignored.
  #   Security issue 2: if RPATH/RUNPATH references relative subdirs, intruder may fool it by using softlinks
