# CL_CONFIG_USE_FAST_RELAXED_MATH [bool] - determine whether build kernels with -cl-fast-relaxed-math option
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE [size] -
#       examples: 16384, 131072, 67108864
#       force CPU to work with specified maximum work-group size.
#       Out of bounds values are clamped to [8192, 67108864].
#       NOTE: Consider increasing CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE and
#             CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE if the value is large.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B
#       force CPU to work with specified global memory size, this will also affect max memory
#           allocation size unless CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE is used too
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B

#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 8MB, 8192KB, 8388608B
#       force CL_DEVICE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE for CPU device to be the given value.
#       NOTE: Usage of this configuration option requires additional amount of
#             stack. You have to compile your application with enough size of
#             stack: OpenCL runtime requires at least 4MB + value of
#             CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 8MB, 8192KB, 8388608B
#       set CPU_DEV_MAX_WG_PRIVATE_SIZE for CPU device to be the given value.
#       NOTE: Usage of this configuration option requires additional amount of
#             stack. You have to compile your application with enough size of
#             stack: OpenCL runtime requires at least 4MB + value of
#             CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_VECTORIZER_MODE [mode]
#       Control vectorization mode of the CPU compiler. Applies only then CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = True.
#       0: (default) Automonous vectorization. The compiler makes heuristic decisions whether to vectorize
#          each kernel, and if so to what vector length.
#       1: No compiler vectorization. Explicit kernel vector data types are left intact.
#          The same as if CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = False.
#       [4, 8, 16]: Disable heuristic and force vectorization to the specified length.
#
#       NOTE: Some kernels do not support vectorization from functional aspect. Such kernels cannot be vectorized in any mode.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_RT_LOOP_UNROLL_FACTOR [factor]
#       Control loop unrolling of loops with non-constant trip count. Out of bounds values are clamped to [1, 16].
#       examples: 1, 2, 3, 16
#       1: no RT unrolling (default)
#       [2, 16]: unrolling factor
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS [unsigned number] -
#       Control the number of TBB workers/threads. Work-groups can be executed
#           parallelly by CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS threads.
#       Out of bounds values are clamped to [1, MAX_NUM].
#           cpu device: MAX_NUM is the number of logical CPU cores.
#                       Default value is MAX_NUM.
#           fpga-emu device: MAX_NUM is 256. Default value is 32.
#       NOTE: If CL_CONFIG_CPU_TBB_NUM_WORKERS is 1, work-groups are executed
#             sequentially by a single thread.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_TARGET_ARCH [cpu target arch] -
#       examples: skx, core-avx2, corei7-avx, corei7
#       force a SIMD instruction set used for OpenCL(TM) kernel compilation.
#
# CL_CONFIG_AUTO_MEMORY [bool]
#       True: (default) the stack size for kernel execution will be allocated automatically
#             and CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE, CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE
#             should also be set as the max private and local memory for WG execution.
#       False: the stack size for kernel execution is under control of
#              CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE and CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE.
#       NOTE: Only support FPGA Emulator device. Usage of this configuration
#             option may also require compiling your application with enough
#             size of stack.
#
# CL_CONFIG_STACK_DEFAULT_SIZE
#       Applies only when CL_CONFIG_AUTO_MEMORY = True
#       examples: 4MB (default), 8MB, 16MB
#       This value is the default stack size for kernel execution.
#       If actual stack size is greater than this value, stack reallocation will occur.
#
# CL_CONFIG_STACK_EXTRA_SIZE
#       Applies only when CL_CONFIG_AUTO_MEMORY = True
#       examples: 512KB, 1MB (default), 2MB
#       This value is the extra stack size for execution of builtin and third-party functions.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_STREAMING_ALWAYS    [bool] - determine whether Non-Temporal instructions are used or not
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_EXPENSIVE_MEM_OPT [unsigned number] -
#       examples: 0 (default), 0x0001
#       A bitmap indicating enabled expensive memory optimizations. These
#       optimizations may lead to more JIT compilation time, but give some
#       performance benefit.
#       Available bits:
#       0: OpenCL address space alias analysis
