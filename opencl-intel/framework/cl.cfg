# Intel(R) CPU Runtime for OpenCL(TM) Applications Configuration file
# =======================================================================
#
# Parameters:
# -----------
# CL_CONFIG_LOG_FILE [string] - set the full path of the log file
# CL_CONFIG_DEVICES [string1; string2, string3 | string4 ...] - list of available devices. 
#                              First device is a default device.
# CL_CONFIG_USE_ITT_API           [bool] - determine whether GPA/ITT traces collection is active or not
# CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER        [bool] - determine whether auto-vectorization module is active or not
# CL_CONFIG_USE_VTUNE             [bool] - determine whether VTune AmplifierXE instrumentation is active or not
# CL_CONFIG_USE_TRAPPING          [bool] - determine whether CPU workers trapping is active or not
# CL_CONFIG_USE_FAST_RELAXED_MATH [bool] - determine whether build kernels with -cl-fast-relaxed-math option
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_GLOBAL_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B
#       force CPU to work with specified global memory size, this will also affect max memory 
#           allocation size unless CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE is used too
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_MAX_MEM_ALLOC_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 2GB, 512MB, 65536KB, 16777216B
#       force CPU to work with specified max memory allocation size.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 8MB, 8192KB, 8388608B
#       force CL_DEVICE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE for CPU device to be the given value.
#       NOTE: Usage of this configuration option requires additional amount of
#             stack. You have to compile your application with enough size of
#             stack: OpenCL runtime requires at least 4MB + value of
#             CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_LOCAL_MEM_SIZE.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE [size with units] -
#       examples: 8MB, 8192KB, 8388608B
#       set CPU_DEV_MAX_WG_PRIVATE_SIZE for CPU device to be the given value.
#       NOTE: Usage of this configuration option requires additional amount of
#             stack. You have to compile your application with enough size of
#             stack: OpenCL runtime requires at least 4MB + value of
#             CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_VECTORIZER_MODE [mode]
#       Control vectorization mode of the CPU compiler. Applies only then CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = True.
#       0: (default) Automonous vectorization. The compiler makes heuristic decisions whether to vectorize
#          each kernel, and if so to what vector length.
#       1: No compiler vectorization. Explicit kernel vector data types are left intact.
#          The same as if CL_CONFIG_USE_VECTORIZER = False.
#       [4, 8, 16]: Disable heuristic and force vectorization to the specified length.
#
#       NOTE: Some kernels do not support vectorization from functional aspect. Such kernels cannot be vectorized in any mode.
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_RT_LOOP_UNROLL_FACTOR [factor]
#       Control loop unrolling of loops with non-constant trip count. Out of bounds values are clamped to [1, 16].
#       examples: 1, 2, 3, 16
#       1: no RT unrolling (default)
#       [2, 16]: unrolling factor
#
# CL_CONFIG_CPU_TARGET_ARCH [cpu target arch] -
#       examples: skx, core-avx2, corei7-avx, corei7
#       force a SIMD instruction set used for OpenCL(TM) kernel compilation.
