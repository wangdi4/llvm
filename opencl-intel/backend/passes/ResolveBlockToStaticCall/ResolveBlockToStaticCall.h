/*===----------------------------------------------------------------------===
This optimization pass is implementing resolution from indirect call to static call
for block invoke functions.

Background.
There are block constructs in OpenCL2.0.
Block is sort of lambda function. Block call is implemented as function pointer call in LLVM.
Example: %call = call i32 %10(i8* %6, i32 %8)

Problem.
It is required by spec that block call should be static.
Call in example should be resolved to:
%call = call i32 @__block_for_cond_block_invoke(i8* %6, i32 %8)

This optimization pass is implementing this resolution.

The pass can be extended to statically resolve enqueued blocks.
However it is not needed now for CPU.
