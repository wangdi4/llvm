/// if the chances of harming performance this way seems very small.

/// 1. KernelAnalysis pass determined barrier pass must be used (usually a sign of a barrier)
/// 2. get_local_id or get_group_id are used.
/// 3. local memory is used.

/// later unite several workgroups to run together, so we dare not switch dimensions,
/// because it is likely there is not enough size avaialble to support vectorization
