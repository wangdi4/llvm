// This pass is a work around to overcome problematic behaviour of LICM.
// LICM does not hoist calls instruction that are under if since they
// might not halt (all calls fails safeToSpeculativeExecute).
// This pass hoists built-ins that we know that are safe to hoist and have all
// argumnets invariant.
// The main drawback of this pass is that it may depend on LICM to hoist
// instructions in order to hoist the built-ins calls (LICM might make the
// arguments invariant) but LICM depends on it in order to deduce that the call
// result is invariant. However, it capture cases like get_image_height etc.. 
// which are the main reasons for it.
// A better solution is to add an attribute to function calls, and modify LICM 
// to hoist these call by itself, and also to add AliasAnalysis that will
// correctly deduce alias of image built-ins.
