/*
 * Part of the tests that check different LLVM instructions on different argument

 *
 * Tests the LLVM inttoptr instruction when it recieves int input argument and turns
 * it into pointer to int. This test uses ptrdiff_t in order to have 32 bit int
 * on 32 bit architecture and 64 bit int on 64 bit architecture.
 * This instruction is vectorizable.
 *
 * @param in
 * 		The input array.
 * @param out
 * 		The output array.
