Running a recorder
===================

1. General
----------

The recorder is a plugin to our tool chain, (i.e., backend and frontend).
The recorder has two operating modes: bytecode mode and source code mode. When
in source mode, the recorder will capture the source code of the application in
OpenCL when possible. When in bytecode mode, the source code of the application
will always be in llvm-bytecode.

2. Enabling the recorder
------------------------

The recorder is controlled by the following environment variables:

1. OCLBACKEND_PLUGINS:	should be set to the dynamic library of the OCLRecorder.
  (libOclRecorder.so on linux, OclRecorder.dll on windows). On linux systems,
  it is important to remember to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so it
  the OS will find the recorder in runtime.

2. OCL_DISABLE_SOURCE_RECORDER: when set,
   the recorder will avoid recording the application in source-level. Rather,
   the OCL code will be captured in its byte-code form.

3. OCLRECORDER_DUMPPREFIX: prefix to be added for the generated files.

4. OCLRECORDER_LOGDIR: path for the generated files.
