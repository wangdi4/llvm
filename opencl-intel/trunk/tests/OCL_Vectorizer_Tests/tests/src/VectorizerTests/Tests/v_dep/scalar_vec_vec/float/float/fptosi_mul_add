 * Tests the LLVM vectorizable add instruction appearing after the vectorizable
 * mul instruction when they both receives as input 2 short arguments produced
 * by previous (vectorizable) fptosi instruction that receives constants and
 * function arguments as input and therfore will have scalar value.
 *
 * @param in
 * 		The input array.
 * @param out
 * 		The output array.
