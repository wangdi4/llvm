// ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION:
//
//   gentype nan(uintn nancode) function returns a quiet NaN. The nancode may
//                           be placed in the significand of the resulting NaN
//                           as described in [1].
//
//   All binary NaN bit strings have all the bits of the biased exponent field
//   set to 1. A quiet NaN bit string should be encoded with the first bit (d1)
//   of the trailing significand field being 1. A signaling NaN bit string
should
//   be encoded with the first bit of the trailing significand field being 0. If
//   the first bit of the trailing significand field is 0, some other bit of the
//   trailing significand field must be non-zero to distinguish the NaN from
//   infinity. In the preferred encoding just described, a signaling NaN shall
be
//   quieted by setting d1 to 1, leaving the remaining bits unchanged.
//   For binary formats, the payload is encoded in the p - 2 least significant
//   bits of the trailing significand field. See [2].
//
//   Implementation is as follows:
//     return bits of nancode | 0x7ff8000000000000
//                                         for double precision
//     return bits of nancode | 0x7fc00000 for single precision
//                                         leaving sign and payload intact,
//                                         ensuring exponent is all ones, MSB
//                                         in significant is one.
